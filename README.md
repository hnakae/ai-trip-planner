## App Idea: AI trip planner app with calendar notification

host on vercel -> landing page (view demo vid)-> sign up -> sign in -> Create New Trip Plan => name -> date range -> location -> budget -> other preferences -> Generate Plan => (output)

generate 2 plans, A and B.

A: for visiting X location at Y date range, visit X location at A o’clock because weather will be B. (plus breakfast/lunch/dinner)
B: same as above except choose a different X location or different food locations.

find airbnb near location -> breakfast, lunch, location+sweets, dinner

ouput list: (show A and B side by side) [user selects the one he likes] [can customize before saving] [export saved plans to a Calendar app] (ipad one)
